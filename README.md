# Tetris
This project is a Java implementation of the Tetris Game.

## How to run
If you have downloaded the source code you can run it by compiling the Game.java file in the src directory.

This would work with the following commands (assuming that you are already in the project root directory):
```
cd src
javac Game.java
java Game
```

If you want to run this game in a command line mode just append the argument `cli` to the `java` call
